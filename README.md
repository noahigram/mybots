# mybots

To run the evolved an un evolved robots, run search.py. Two simulation windows should appear after the evolutions have finished (their windows might be overlayed). One of which is the final evolved robot, and the other is the worst iteration. The fitness function was not modified because the chosen behavior for the robot was to avoid obstacles along its leftward path. The fitness function optimizes the robots leftward x position, so a robot that ends with a more negative x position will be considered more fit.
